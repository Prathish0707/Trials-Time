# QR Code Generator using Python  
## Mini Project Documentation

---

## 1. Introduction

A QR Code (Quick Response Code) is a two-dimensional barcode that stores information such as text, URLs, contact details, or other data. QR codes are widely used in daily life for fast and easy data sharing.

This mini project titled **“QR Code Generator using Python”** is developed to understand how Python can be used to generate QR codes programmatically. The project is implemented using **Python** and executed in **Google Colab**, which provides an online environment for running Python code without installing software locally.

This project helps beginners learn how to use external Python libraries and apply basic programming concepts to create a real-world application.

## 2. Objective of the Project

The main objectives of this mini project are:

- To understand the concept of QR codes  
- To learn how to use Python libraries  
- To generate QR codes from text or URLs  
- To gain hands-on experience with Google Colab  
- To improve basic Python programming skills  

---

## 3. Tools and Technologies Used

The following tools and technologies are used in this project:

- **Python** – Programming language used for development  
- **Google Colab** – Online platform to run Python code  
- **qrcode library** – Used to generate QR codes  
- **Pillow (PIL)** – Used for image handling

## 4. Project Description

The QR Code Generator is a simple Python-based application that converts user-provided data into a QR code image. The user can enter any text or URL, and the program will generate a QR code corresponding to that input.

The generated QR code is saved as an image file (PNG format). This QR code can be scanned using any standard QR code scanner available on mobile devices.

The project is designed to be simple, lightweight, and easy to understand, making it suitable for beginners and college mini project submissions.

## 5. Working Principle

The working of the QR Code Generator is explained below:

1. The required Python library is installed in Google Colab  
2. The user provides text or a URL as input  
3. The qrcode library processes the input data  
4. A QR code image is generated  
5. The image is saved as a PNG file  

This process happens within a few seconds and does not require complex logic.

## 6. Implementation Details

The project uses the `qrcode` Python library to generate QR codes. The library converts the input data into a matrix format, which is then rendered as an image.

The implementation is done in a Google Colab notebook, which allows easy execution and modification of code. No additional setup is required apart from installing the necessary library.

The project structure is simple and consists of a single Python notebook file and the generated QR code image.
